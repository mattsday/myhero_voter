# Evil Voter
This is proof of concept code to cause massive votes for Star Lord in Hank Preston's ["My Hero"](https://github.com/hpreston/myhero_demo/) app.

It comprises of two parts:

1. ```docker-image``` - a docker file with a small piece of python code
2. ```mantl-service``` - basic mantl service and shell script to deploy

It is designed as a proof of concept to show microservices, not as a malicious death rays from space destroyer.

Have fun!
